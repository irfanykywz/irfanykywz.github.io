## Core Ideas

- Small improvements compound over time. Focus on 1% better every day.
- Habits are formed by the cue → craving → response → reward loop.
- Identity-based habits: become the kind of person who does the habit.

## Practical Applications

1. Make it obvious: environment design, habit stacking.
2. Make it attractive: temptation bundling, reframe benefits.
3. Make it easy: reduce friction, 2-minute rule.
4. Make it satisfying: immediate rewards, accountability.

## My Notes

Changing the environment worked better than willpower. I applied the 2-minute rule to start writing daily and it reduced the startup cost enough that I kept going.
